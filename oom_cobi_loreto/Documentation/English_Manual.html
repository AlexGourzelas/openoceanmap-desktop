<h2>OpenOceanMap Loreto Bay Documentation</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To start an interview, click the "Interview" menu button and select "Start Interview".  Alternatively,
 you can click the start interview icon which has a picture of a red pencil.  One interview is done per person.</p>
<p>To add additional vector and raster layers to the map for use in drawing shapes, use the 'Add raster layer' and 'Add vector layer'
options in the Map menu or click the appropriate icon on the toolbar.</p>
<h3>Drawing Shapes</h3>
<p>Once you select to start drawing shapes, move to the appropriate area on the map using the pan and zoom buttons.  To begin a shape
click once with your <b>left</b> mouse button.  This will create the first point.  Continue adding points by moving your mouse and clicking
with your <b>left</b> mouse button.  Complete your shape by clicking once with your <b>right</b> mouse button.  Continue as directed.</p> 

<h3>Using The Map</h3>
<p>The legend on the left allows you to turn on and off the map layer.  By default all of them
are turned on except for the bathymetry layer.  The layers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loreto Base Map - includes the mainland, islands and sea bottom shaded relief.</li>
<li>Study Area - black line outlining the area of study in Loreto Bay National Park</li>
<li>Bathymetry - bathymetry lines in regular intervals.  Units are in fathoms - (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800)
<li>Restricted Zones - restricted areas around the shorelines</li>
<li>Protected Zones - protected areas on land and sea.
<li>Protected Zones (pts) - Additional locations that are protected.  Represented as red triangles</li>
<li>Seamounts - deep reef seamount locations</li>
<li>Reference Points - navigational reference points.  They appear once you zoom in on the map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things To Note</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>You may come across software bugs.  If you do please report them to Ecotrust Knowledge Systems</li>
 <li>You cannot go back and change values in the middle of an interview.  Try to get it right the first time.  If
 you need to change something you will need to start over or if you know what you're doing simply finish the interview 
 and alter the shapefile outputs accordingly.</li>
 <li>Re-sorting of map layers is not supported.  Adding any additional layers will simply place them on top of the default layers
 </li>
 <li>On occasion when interviewing for multiple user groups in one interview, you will notice attributes for one user group showing up in the file for another user group.
 For example if you interview for both Ecotourism and Other, the emp_type attribute for ecotourism will show up in the CSV file for Other.  This is because it is 
 not cleared appropriately when moving to the next user group.  This is a known issue and is not of concern as long as you know which attribute to use based on the user
 group</li>
 <li>If you are unable to start a new interview, simply close OpenOceanMap and run it again.  This is a known issue
 </li>
</ul>
